  ## S3 Mirroring
  
  This action supports synchronizing `taskDefinitions` to S3. It is designed to work in concert with Cloud Posse's [`ecs-service`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/ecs-service) component, that will upload a task definition template to S3. This action will then pull that template from S3 and merge it with the local task definition from the repository. Finally, `ecspresso` will be called to deploy the merged task definition to ECS.
  
  This action will then upload the `task-definition.json` that was rendered back to S3. The `ecs-service` component will use the `task-definition.json` file to deploy the application. This ensures future infrastructure deployments do not override application changes, such as image updates, environment variable changes, etc.
  
  The Infrastructure repository then manages things like Volumes and EFS mounts, and the Application repository manages the application code and environment variables.
